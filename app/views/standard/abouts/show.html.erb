		My Father keeps the PM waiting (MFKPMW) is a slightly difficult-to-categorise creative writing project, based on the life-story of my father, who died in 2002.
	</p>
	<p>
		It's a long-term project, and I have no idea when (or whether) I will finish it. So I'm planning to put work-in-progress on this site - partly to encourage myself to write more, and also in the hope that you might be interested in following the development of the project.
	</p>
	<p>
		MFKPMW falls into two main parts.
	</p>
	<p>
		<%= link_to "My Father keeps the PM waiting (1970)", part_sections_path(Part.find_by(title: "My Father keeps the PM waiting (1970)")) %> is a heavily fictionalised, novel-length account of a pivotal week in my father's life; the few days before and after the 1970 General Election, in which he worked as a key publicity adviser to Harold Wilson.
	</p>
	<p>
		<%= link_to "My Father (1926-2002)", part_sections_path(Part.find_by(title: "My Father (1926 - 2002)")) %> consists of a series of short pieces based on incidents and scenes from the entirety of my father's life. Again, most of these are heavily fictionalised, though a few are drawn directly from life, when they relate to my own recollections of my father.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I'm writing about a fictional character based, more or less loosely, on my father, he appears as My Father; when I am writing about the man I remember, it's my father.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, if you would like to know more about who my father really was, you can read one of his obituaries <%= link_to "here", 'https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/jan/29/guardianobituaries', target: :_blank %>, and his Who's Who entry (of which he was immensely proud) <%= link_to "here", "http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/10.1093/ww/9780199540891.001.0001/ww-9780199540884-e-9989", target: :_blank %>.
